        <h2>A geological vault</h2>
        <p>
          Once CO2 is captured and transported, it’s stored deep underground.
          Only certain places have the right geological formations for CO2
          storage. The Pathways Alliance storage hub near Cold Lake is ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This location has a deep layer of sandstone. Sandstone is porous,
          which means it’s full of small spaces, like a sponge. When injected
          underground in liquid form, CO2 fills these miniscule spaces in the
          rock. The layer could eventually store more than 1.1 billion tonnes of
          CO2 .
        </p>
        <p>
          Above the sandstone layer lies hundreds of metres of rock salt, which
          act as a natural seal. Beneath is metamorphic basement rock, which is
          impermeable (it has no spaces).
        </p>
        <p>
          Constant monitoring at every depth ensures stored CO2 remains secure
          and stable.
