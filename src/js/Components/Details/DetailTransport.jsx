        <h2>A transportation line for the region</h2>
        <p>
          Our carbon capture and storage project will serve multiple oil sands
          facilities, all at once. A transportation line connects each facility
          to a central storage hub. This line carries captured CO2 in liquid
          form to a location where it can be stored underground.
        </p>
        <p>
          The transportation line is more than 400 km long. In phase one, it
          will connect 14 oil sands facilities to the storage hub, eventually
          serving more than 20.
        </p>
        <p>
          The network isnâ€™t just for the oil sands. In the future, this
          transportation line can help other industries in the region capture
          and store CO2.
