        <p>
          CCS means carbon capture and storage. It’s a technology that traps,
          transports and stores industrial CO2 emissions so they never end up in
          the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Large-scale projects in Norway and the U.S. have shown that CCS can
          reduce emissions safely and reliably.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pathways CCS project could reduce net CO2 emissions by 10 to 12
          million tonnes per year by 2030, from 14 oil sands production
          facilities. And that’s only the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>It’s a big step forward on the path to net zero.</p>
