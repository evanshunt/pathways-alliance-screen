        <h2>Climate change is a critical challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Canada's oil sands have a shared goal: net-zero by 2050. But no
          company can get there alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pathways Alliance is a team-up of Canada's six largest oil sands
          producers. Our companies make up 95% of Canada's oil sands industry.
          Together, we can go farther, faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're also working with provincial and federal governments to help
          Canada meet its Paris Climate Agreement goals. By 2030, our plan could
          reduce absolute CO2 emissions from oil sands by 22 million tonnes per
          year.
